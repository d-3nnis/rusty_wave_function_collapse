# Rusty Wave Function Collapse

This project is a very simple implementation of the Wave Function Collapse algorithm in Rust. It currently only supports ASCII tiles and direct adjacancy rules.

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/d-3nnis/rusty_wave_function_collapse.git
cd rusty_wave_function_collapse
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

To use this project, you can run the `generate` binary:

```sh
cargo run --release --bin generate
```

This will generate a pattern using the Wave Function Collapse algorithm and print it to the console.
